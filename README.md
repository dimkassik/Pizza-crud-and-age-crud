# Pizza-crud-and-age-crud
projects are made on django framework and python.
In order for the project to work, you need to create a superuser account through the command in the terminal: 
"python manage.py createsuperuser" 
run the server through:
"python manage.py runserver" 
and go to the site http://localhost:8000/admin. 
In a project with pizzerias, you can create restaurants and link pizzas to them. 
In a project with age, you can enter a person's ID (in the format yymmdd) consisting of 12 characters (otherwise the age will not be calculated) 
and after that the age of the person to whom this ID belongs will be calculated
